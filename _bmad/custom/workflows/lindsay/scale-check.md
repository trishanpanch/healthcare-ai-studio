# Operational Scalability Review

**Context**: We are moving from pilot to scale.
*Note: Please read 'project-brief.md' and 'PRD.md' if available in the {project-root} or current context.*

**Instructions**:
Critique this workflow:
1. Where is the friction for the frontline clinician?
2. How does this work for a patient with 5 chronic conditions at home?
3. Is this solution 'point-solution fatigue', or is it truly integrated?

**Output**: An operational scalability critique.
