## 🎓 Course Context

### Building AI solutions to Transform Healthcare
*Part of the AI & Healthcare Specialization (Advanced Certificate Track)*

**Positioning:** This is the capstone course of the specialization. While previous courses focus on governance, internal implementation, or observing innovation, this course is about **becoming an innovator**.

**Core Learning Objective:**
By the end of the course, participants will be able to lead an AI-enabled digital transformation from **idea → product → deployment → pitch**, using a repeatable, open, AI-native method.

### 👥 Faculty
*   **Course Co-Leads:**
    *   **Dr. Trishan Panch** (Executive Director, AI in Healthcare Specialization)
    *   **Prof. Rifat Atun** (Professor of Global Health Systems, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health)
*   **Practical & Technical Faculty:** Gianluca Mauro, Luke Piyapilli
*   **Guest Lecturers:** John Brownstein, Lindsay Jubelt, Alan Karthikesalingam

## 💻 The Software: Healthcare AI Studio

The "Healthcare AI Studio" is the core technical spine of the course. It is an open-access software platform developed at Harvard University that represents the cutting edge of agentic AI software development best practices.

**What It Is:**
*   A healthcare-specific adaptation of agentic AI standards.
*   An AI-native product development system.
*   Built around **multiple AI agents**, each representing expert roles on your team.

**Why It's Powerful:**
Participants do not just "prompt an LLM". They orchestrate a virtual expert council. The system enforces structured reasoning, consistent documentation, and repeatable decision-making.

### Your Expert Team
Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the course, this studio comes pre-staffed with three specialized persona agents:

#### 1. Trishan (Strategy & VC) `[TP]`
*   **Role:** Executive Strategy & Clinical AI Architect.
*   **Focus:** Balancing clinical rigor with venture scalability.
*   **Trigger:** `@Trishan` or `[TP]`

#### 2. Rifat (Global Health) `[RA]`
*   **Role:** Professor of Global Health Systems.
*   **Focus:** Health systems innovation, diagonal approach, and scalability in LMICs.
*   **Trigger:** `@Rifat` or `[RA]`

#### 3. Lindsay (Clinical Operations) `[LJ]`
*   **Role:** Chief Clinical Officer & VBC Strategist.
*   **Focus:** Value-Based Care, population health at scale, and payer-provider integration.
*   **Trigger:** `@Lindsay` or `[LJ]`
